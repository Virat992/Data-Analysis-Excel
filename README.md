# E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel
## by Virat Gajjar

## Overview
This project revolves around the exploration and analysis of sales data from an online e-commerce store, MyStore.
Specializing in clothing for females, MyStore operates across various e-commerce platforms, including Amazon, Flipkart,
Myntra, Meesho, Ajio, and more. As a dedicated data analyst, my mission was to extract insightful exploratory insights
that address vital management questions.

## Dashboard and Visualization
The culmination of this analysis is a dynamic dashboard that presents the insights through an array of interactive
visualizations. These visualizations encompass:

    Bar Charts: Effectively displaying the top 5 sales states and the distribution of orders across different
    sales channels.
    Pie Chart: Illustrating the ratio of male to female buyers, providing an instant demographic overview.
    Histogram: Depicting the distribution of orders across sales channels, shedding light on potential trends.
    
The dashboard leverages Pivot charts and employs fundamental Excel formulas such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, among others,
to create a comprehensive visual representation of the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for analysis comprises information related to 32,000 orders placed during a sale period on various
e-commerce websites. The majority of these orders pertain to female clothing items. The dataset encompasses 19 features,
including 'Index', 'Order_id', 'Customer_id', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Date', 'State', 'Channel', 'SKU', 'Product_category', 'Size',
'Amount', 'Status', 'Quantity', 'Currency', and more.

## Data Cleaning

Prior to analysis, a rigorous data cleaning process was carried out. This involved eliminating duplicate and empty records,
ensuring the dataset's integrity. During feature engineering, new columns were introduced to enhance the analysis:

    Age Group: The original 'Age' values were grouped into specific ranges for simplified graphical representation.
    Month: Extracted from the 'Date' column, the 'Month' feature helps in temporal analysis.
