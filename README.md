# E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel
## by Virat Gajjar

## Overview
This project revolves around the exploration and analysis of sales data from an online e-commerce store, MyStore.
Specializing in clothing for males and females, MyStore operates across various e-commerce platforms, including Amazon, Flipkart,
Myntra, Meesho, Ajio, and more. As a dedicated data analyst, my mission was to extract insightful exploratory insights
that address vital management questions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for analysis comprises information related to 32,000 orders placed during a sale period on various
e-commerce websites. The majority of these orders pertain to male and female clothing items. The dataset encompasses 19 features,
including 'Index', 'Order_id', 'Customer_id', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Date', 'State', 'Channel', 'SKU', 'Product_category', 'Size',
'Amount', 'Status', 'Quantity', 'Currency', and more.

## Data Cleaning

Prior to analysis, a rigorous data cleaning process was carried out. This involved eliminating duplicate and empty records, ensuring the dataset's integrity. During feature engineering, new columns were introduced to enhance the analysis:

- **Age Group:** The original 'Age' values were grouped into specific ranges for simplified graphical representation.
- **Month:** Extracted from the 'Date' column, the 'Month' feature helps in temporal analysis.

## Dashboard and Visualization

The culmination of this analysis is a dynamic dashboard that presents the insights through an array of interactive visualizations. These visualizations encompass:

- **Bar Charts:** Effectively displaying the top 5 sales states and the distribution of orders across different sales channels.

- **Pie Chart:** Illustrating the ratio of male to female buyers, providing an instant demographic overview.

- **Histogram:** Depicting the distribution of orders across sales channels, shedding light on potential trends.
  
# Project Highlights

## Top 5 Sales States
Throughout this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis to address one of the pivotal management questions: identifying the top five states responsible for the highest sales contribution to MyStore. These insights offer a strategic foundation for targeted marketing campaigns and optimizing resource allocation.

## Male vs. Female Buyer Distribution
Another key aspect of my analysis focused on the distribution of male and female buyers among MyStore's customers. This deep understanding of the demographic landscape is essential for crafting personalized marketing strategies tailored to distinct customer segments.

## Orders Distribution across Sales Channels
My exploration encompassed a comprehensive view of the distribution of orders across various sales channels, including Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Meesho, and Ajio. This information serves as a navigational tool to fine-tune resource allocation and optimize the performance of each sales channel.
